:warning: **I let my old domain: numetriclabs.com expire so just be warned that I no longer operate the numetriclabs.com domain.** The person currently operating my old domain is claiming to be me, and hosting a broken version of this website. 

:bulb: **Because this is an archive of my older portfolio website, some of the links might be broken**, or lead to websites that have since been redesigned or taken offline.
