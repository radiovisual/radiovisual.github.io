His uncle was tortured in Syria, and he now finds it difficult to work as he cannot stand for more than a few minutes. Mustafa has become the family’s breadwinner and works every day in a shoe store for $US7 a day. He is proud of his role providing for his family but it is also a crushing burden for a child.</p>

                <p>Children like Mustafa, some as young as seven, must work long hours with little pay  and in some cases, in dangerous conditions. In such circumstances, they are also forfeiting their future by missing out on an education.  The majority of working children are boys, although some girls are employed, mostly in agriculture and domestic work.</p>

                <p>Child labour has reached critical levels. According to UNICEF, an estimated one in ten Syrian refugee children in the region is engaged in child labour.<a href="#footnote10" class="footnote-number">10</a>  UNHCR and partners said it is one of the most widespread and complex of all child protection problems. </p>
                <p>In Jordan, a recent assessment covering 11 governorates<a href="#" class="footnote-number">11</a> found that 47 per cent of 186 households with one or more working family member relied partly or entirely on the income generated by a child.<a href="#footnote10" class="footnote-number">12</a>  A UNICEF/Save the Children assessment in the Jordan Valley, conducted in April 2013, found that out of 3,500 school-aged children, 1,700 were working.<a href="#footnote10" class="footnote-number">13</a> </p>

                <p>The prevalence of child labour is likely to be even higher than reported numbers suggest. Many children work intermittently, picking up short-term jobs that may change from day to day. It is difficult to identify working children in both urban and rural contexts because refugee populations are often dispersed.</p>

                <p>Given that child labour is illegal in both Jordan and Lebanon<a href="#footnote10" class="footnote-number">14</a>, employers and refugee families are likely to hide the problem, fearing the ramifications of being identified. Further, some parents fear that if humanitarian organizations discover their children working, it might undermine their eligibility for financial assistance.</p>

                <p>According to UNHCR’s Killian Kleinschmidt in Za’atari camp, <span class="tweet-me-light">“There are around 680 shops in Za’atari - all of them employ children.” <img src="img/twitter-16x20-blue.png"/></span> Manal Eid, Programme Development Manager with War Child Holland in Lebanon said that  “If you go on the street, you Syrian children working everywhere.”  </p>

However, UNHCR and partner staff said that a number of Syrian refugee girls also work, mostly in agriculture, domestic work or child care. The findings of a recent inter-agency suggest that up to 80 per cent of Syrian refugee girls working in Jordan are employed in these two sectors.<a href="#footnote10" class="footnote-number">15</a></p>

During interviews, three boys in Lebanon, aged 10, 11 and 13, reported being injured at work. One was burned by hot oil at a restaurant; one cut his hand while fixing a car mirror; and another was beaten by the son of his boss.</p>

                    <p>But for the moment, his reality is very different. He lives with his parents, aunt, grandparents
                        and two younger siblings. His father cannot find a job. Ayman is the only family member working,
                        selling gum on the street. He makes $US4 a day.</p>

                    <p>He said his job was “very difficult” and that he was harassed for being Syrian. A man even kicked
                        him for selling gum during Ramadan. He would prefer to be in school, but it was Ayman himself
                        who decided to work to support the family. </p>

                    <p>Ayman proudly looks after his younger siblings, and his face lit up when he described how he
                        saved up enough to buy his five year-old sister a new dress for Eid al Fitr.</p>

                    <p>But there are few sources of happiness in Ayman’s own life. He has no friends and is embarrassed

                        hopes for the future, Ayman said that he wants his father to find work so that he can go to
                        school.</p>

                    <p>Child labour is directly linked to the basic survival of refugee families. Many Syrian families fled with only what they could carry—a change of clothes; precious documents or photos; and for some, a baby or toddler who could not walk long distances through fields or across borders. </p>

                    <p>The savings, assets and possessions of most Syrian refugees were lost or destroyed. Their sources of livelihood came to an abrupt end: their lives were essentially frozen.</p>

                    <p>Assessments on child labour, conducted both within Syria and in host countries, indicate that the primary reason children work is to support their families.<a href="#footnote10" class="footnote-number">16</a>  An inter-agency rapid needs assessment conducted in Lebanon in early 2013, found that the money earned by Syrian refugee children was predominantly used to pay for rent and food.<a href="#footnote10" class="footnote-number">17</a></p>


                    <p>Some families do receive financial assistance from UNHCR but resources are severely stretched. Assistance only reaches the most vulnerable, and is not always sufficient to cover all their needs. Many refugee families in both Jordan and Lebanon have no alternative but to send their children to seek work.</p>

                    <p>Even when accompanied by their families, many refugee children still need to work. Their parents or caregivers can face legal and social barriers to taking on employment themselves.</p>

                    <p>During interviews and focus group discussions, parents and children said it is easier for a child to find work and the ramifications of being caught are less severe.  One mother in Zarqa, Jordan, explained why her son works while her husband does not: “A boy can take the abuse and insults, a man can’t. So the men stay at home and the children work.”</p>

                    <p>However, most  parents whose children were working made it clear that they did not take the situation lightly. UNHCR and partner staff said that Syrian refugee children often work of their own volition to help their families, not because they are necessarily forced by their parents to do so.</p>

                    <p>For some Syrian refugee families, particularly from rural parts of Syria, it is part of their culture for children to start working at a young age. According to a 2012 assessment conducted in Syria by the International Labour Organization (ILO), 18 per cent of children between 10 and 17 years old were working.<a href="#footnote10" class="footnote-number">18</a>  However, most of the children interviewed during field research only started working since becoming refugees, with several UNHCR and partner staff also noting this as the general trend.</p>

                    <p>In some female-headed households, mothers felt they could not work because it is considered culturally unacceptable, so they asked their sons to work instead. The ILO assessment from 2012 similarly concluded that one reason behind the acceptance of child labour was that it allowed mothers to avoid working in the absence of a working father.<a href="#footnote10" class="footnote-number">19</a></p>

                <p>Child labour is illegal in both Jordan and Lebanon, and their concern at running afoul of the law was a major concern raised by working boys during focus group discussions in both countries. During individual interviews, two boys in Jordan reported that they had previously been arrested and held for over five hours. One had been working in a cafeteria, the other in a motor shop.</p>

                <p>UNHCR’s Killian Kleinschmidt, said that his main concern with regard to child labour in Za’atari camp is that boys could slip into the world of smuggling where they can be used as decoys, distracting the police, for example, while adults smuggle goods out of the camp. Trenches have recently been dug to prevent vehicles from getting in and out of the camp, but smugglers are trying to use children to fill them in.</p>

            <div class="body_text">
                <p>Individual case management is a core aspect of the child protection response in both Lebanon and Jordan. UN agencies and their partners have established functioning referral systems throughout both countries to identify children who face protection risks, manage their cases, and refer them to appropriate services.<a href="" class="footnote-number">20</a> </p>

                <p>Case managers and social workers visit refugees in their homes to assess their needs. In addition to providing social counselling and emotional support, they develop an action plan with families to promote their children’s safety and help to ensure that they can attend school or take part in other educational services. Where possible, they work together to remove children from the work force, or at least minimize the negative effects of working. In serious cases of violence, abuse or neglect, national authorities become involved.</p>

                <p>Case managers and social workers emphasize to parents the importance of education, the potentially harmful effects of child labour, and the impact that domestic violence has on children. Given the pressing financial needs of many families, it is often not possible to find a way for children to stop working. In such situations, case managers also interact directly with children’s employers to minimize the risks they face in the workplace. This can include providing materials to improve their safety at work, and negotiating with employers to ensure they can access at least informal education alongside work.</p>

                <p>Where necessary, case managers and social workers refer children to UNHCR and partners for specialized services such as health care, psychosocial support, or legal advice. In certain cases, they might also help families to access financial assistance, or provide in-kind donations from private donors such as clothing or toys. Case managers and social workers follow up regularly with children and their families, and monitor implementation of the action plan.</p>
