        "description": "The story of 15-year-old Khaled in Za'atari camp, Jordan, captures not only the pain, pressure and fear that many unaccompanied and separated children feel, but also their resilience in the face of an uncertain future and new responsibilities.When asked whether he misses his mother, Khaled tugged the brim of his baseball cap low over his face and began to cry.'I miss coming home and finding her there,' he said.' I miss having her around us, to sit with her, to actually get to see her face.'His parents divorced before the conflict began. As fighting escalated, Khaled's mother fled north to Idlib in 2012, while his father stayed in Daraa. Shortly afterwards, Khaled, his brother and two sisters, and several aunts and cousins escaped to Jordan to join extended family members, while his father stayed behind.Over the course of five months in Za'atari camp, Khaled and his siblings were abandoned by all of their extended family.The pressure the teenager feels to protect and provide for his siblings in an unknown country is often overwhelming.'It was scary,' he said. 'We were suddenly all alone and I found myself responsible for my siblings... If anything were to ever happen to them, I could never live with myself.'Without parents, Khaled has become the family protector, but at a steep price to his own education and future.He would like to move out of the camp, but would then need to find a job and pay rent for an apartment. He has two enduring goals: to reunite with his mother and to send his siblings to school."

        "description": "The last time 16-year-old Maher saw his father was nearly two years ago.Before his family fled the fighting in Syria, he and his father were both detained. Maher was tortured, but released after nine days. His father was not so lucky: he is still missing.Maher now lives in Zarqa, Jordan, where his mother is the only caregiver for his six siblings ranging in age from four to 18 years old. 'I am both mother and father,' she said.Maher just wants his old life back.'My first wish would be to go back to Syria and have my father released,' he said. 'Then for things to go back to the way they were.'Until then, he is facing new challenges and building a new life. He is afraid to work-he cannot do so legally and fears arrest-but he must nevertheless help to support his family. He takes on short-term construction jobs whenever he can, but the lingering effects of the torture he underwent in Syria mean he can only work for a few days at a time without feeling pain in his shoulder."

His father cannot find a job. Ayman is the only family member working, selling gum on the street. He makes US$ 4 a day.He said his job was 'very difficult' and that he was harassed for being Syrian. A man even kicked him for selling gum during Ramadan. He would prefer to be in school, but it was Ayman himself who decided to work to support the family.Ayman proudly looks after his younger siblings, and his face lit up when he described how he saved up enough to buy his five-year-old sister a new dress for Eid al-Fitr.But there are few sources of happiness in Ayman's own life. He has no friends and is embarrassed by his work, so has not tried to socialize with other boys in the building. When asked about his hopes for the future, Ayman said that he wants his father to find work so that he can go to school."

Their answers tended to be rooted in financial concerns. One wanted money to pay rent, since this would make his life entirely different. Another said that getting a job was his most important concern. All the boys agreed that their number one desire is to go home.One 12-year-old boy working in carpentry said he wanted 'a different job, any job.' His issue was not the nature of the job, nor the conditions of his work, but the simple fact that he did not earn enough to pay his family's rent.Many working boys accept their fate as providers for their families. A 14-year-old boy in Jeb Jannine, Lebanon, said that his 12-year-old brother goes to school while he works in a rock quarry. He described the situation as 'a matter of circumstance and luck.'"

Although they qualify for Syrian nationality on the basis of having a Syrian father, there is currently no way to prove this. The girls' father has been detained in Syria for refusing compulsory military service, and their mother-who fled to Jordan whilst pregnant-left Syria without any documents showing marriage registration. Consequently, the children have not been registered in Jordan.The nationality laws of Jordan and Syria do not permit women to confer nationality on children in most circumstances.In addition to being at risk of statelessness, these children are already facing other problems. Each was born with a hole in her heart, and one had both legs broken at birth. The related medical costs were borne out of pocket, as the babies were unregistered and therefore did not qualify for free assistance at public hospitals.While medical assistance can be provided in such cases, unregistered children often have difficulties accessing health care and other basic rights, in addition to facing the risk of statelessness."

As fighting escalated, Khaled's mother fled north to Idlib in 2012, while his father stayed in Daraa. Shortly afterwards, Khaled, his brother and two sisters, and several aunts and cousins escaped to Jordan to join extended family members, while his father stayed behind.Over the course of five months in Za'atari camp, Khaled and his siblings were abandoned by all of their extended family.The pressure the teenager feels to protect and provide for his siblings in an unknown country is often overwhelming.&ldquo;It was scary,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We were suddenly all alone and I found myself responsible for my siblings... If anything were to ever happen to them, I could never live with myself.&rdquo;Without parents, Khaled has become the family protector, but at a steep price to his own education and future.He would like to move out of the camp, but would then need to find a job and pay rent for an apartment. He has two enduring goals: to reunite with his mother and to send his siblings to school."

Although they qualify for Syrian nationality on the basis of having a Syrian father, there is currently no way to prove this. The girls' father has been detained in Syria for refusing compulsory military service, and their mother&mdash;who fled to Jordan whilst pregnant&mdash;left Syria without any documents showing marriage registration. Consequently, the children have not been registered in Jordan.The nationality laws of Jordan and Syria do not permit women to confer nationality on children in most circumstances.In addition to being at risk of statelessness, these children are already facing other problems. Each was born with a hole in her heart, and one had both legs broken at birth. The related medical costs were borne out of pocket, as the babies were unregistered and therefore did not qualify for free assistance at public hospitals.While medical assistance can be provided in such cases, unregistered children often have difficulties accessing health care and other basic rights, in addition to facing the risk of statelessness."
