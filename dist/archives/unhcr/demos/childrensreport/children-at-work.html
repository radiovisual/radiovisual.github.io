                <p>Children like Mustafa, some as young as seven, must work long hours for little pay, and in some cases in dangerous conditions. In such circumstances, they are also forfeiting their future by missing out on an education. The majority of working children are boys, although some girls are employed, mostly in agriculture and domestic work.

                <p>Child labour has reached critical levels. UNICEF estimates that one in ten Syrian refugee children in the region is engaged in child labour.<a href="#footnote10" class="footnote-number">10</a> UNHCR and partners said it is one of the most widespread and complex of all child protection problems.</p>





                <p><span class="tweet-me-light" data-sharemetaid="chil_02"><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Survey%20in%20%23Jordan%3A%2047%25%20of%20households%20with%201%20or%20more%20working%20family%20member%20relied%20on%20a%20child%20to%20work%20%23FutureOfSyria%20http%3A%2F%2Frfg.ee%2FrgyzE%20">A recent assessment covering 11 of Jordan's 12 governorates<span class="footnote-number">11</span> found that 47 per cent of 186 households with one or more working family member relied partly or entirely on the income generated by a child.<span class="footnote-number">12</span><img src="img/twitter-16x20-blue.png" alt=""/></a></span> A UNICEF/Save the Children assessment in the Jordan Valley, conducted in April 2013, yielded a similar finding: 1,700 out of 3,500 school-aged children, or nearly 49 per cent, were working.<a href="#footnote10" class="footnote-number">13</a></p>

                <p>The prevalence of child labour is likely to be even higher than reported numbers suggest. Many children work intermittently, picking up short-term jobs that may change from day to day. It is difficult to identify working children in both urban and rural contexts because refugee populations are often dispersed.</p>

                <p>Given that child labour is illegal in Jordan and Lebanon,<a href="#footnote10" class="footnote-number">14</a> employers and refugee families are likely to hide the problem, fearing the ramifications of being identified. Further, some parents fear that if humanitarian organizations discover their children working, it might undermine their eligibility for financial assistance. According to UNHCR’s Kilian Kleinschmidt in Za’atari camp, &ldquo;There are around 680 shops in Za’atari&mdash;all of them employ children.&rdquo; Manal Eid, Programme Development Manager with War Child Holland in Lebanon, said that &ldquo;If you go on the street, you see Syrian children working everywhere.&rdquo;

Thirty-nine per cent worked in retail, including clothing shops, shoe shops, sweet shops, supermarkets and street stands. A smaller number worked in construction and agriculture.</p>

                <p>During field research, only two girls were found working&mdash;one in a vegetable store and the other as a hairdressing assistant. However, UNHCR and partner staff said that a number of Syrian refugee girls also work, mostly in agriculture or domestic work. The findings of a recent inter-agency assessment suggest that up to 80 per cent of Syrian refugee girls working in Jordan are employed in these two sectors.<a href="#footnote10" class="footnote-number">15</a></p>

                <p>Children working in construction and agriculture can be exposed to dangerous and heavy machinery, the harsh sun and pesticides. For those selling items or begging through car windows at busy intersections, the risk of accidents is high. During interviews, three boys in Lebanon, aged 10, 11 and 13, reported being injured at work. One was burned by hot oil at a restaurant, another cut his hand while fixing a car mirror and the third was beaten by the son of his boss.</p>

                <p>Child labour is directly linked to the basic survival of refugee families. Many Syrian families fled with only what they could carry&mdash;a change of clothes; precious documents or photos; and for some, a baby or toddler who could not walk long distances through fields or across borders.</p>

                <p>The savings, assets and possessions of most Syrian refugees were lost or destroyed. Their livelihoods came to an abrupt end, and their lives were essentially frozen.</p>

                <p>Assessments on child labour, conducted both within Syria and in host countries, indicate that the primary reason children work is to support their families.<a href="#footnote10" class="footnote-number">16</a> An inter-agency rapid needs assessment conducted in Lebanon in early 2013 found that the money earned by Syrian refugee children was predominantly used to pay for rent and food.<a href="#footnote10" class="footnote-number">17</a></p>

                <p>Some families do receive financial assistance from UNHCR, but still their resources are severely stretched. Assistance only reaches the most vulnerable, and is not always sufficient to cover all their needs. Many refugee families in Jordan and Lebanon have no alternative but to send their children to seek work.

                    <p>For some Syrian refugee families, particularly from rural parts of Syria, it is part of their culture for children to start working at a young age. According to a 2012 assessment conducted in Syria by the International Labour Organization (ILO), 18 per cent of children between 10 and 17 years old were working.<a href="#footnote10" class="footnote-number">18</a> However, most of the children interviewed during field research only started working since becoming refugees, with several UNHCR and partner staff also noting this as the general trend.</p>

                    <p>In some female-headed households, mothers felt they could not work because it is considered culturally unacceptable, so they asked their sons to work instead. The 2012 ILO assessment similarly concluded that one reason behind the acceptance of child labour was that it allowed mothers to avoid working in the absence of a working father.<a href="#footnote10" class="footnote-number">19</a></p>

                    <p>Child labour is illegal in both Jordan and Lebanon, and running afoul of the law was a major concern raised by working boys during focus group discussions in both countries. During individual interviews, two boys in Jordan reported that they had previously been arrested and held for over five hours. One had been working in a cafeteria, the other in a motor shop.</p>

                    <p>UNHCR’s Kilian Kleinschmidt said that his main concern with regard to child labour in Za’atari camp is that boys could slip into the world of smuggling, where they can be used as decoys, distracting the police, for example, while adults smuggle goods out of the camp. Trenches have recently been dug to prevent vehicles from getting in and out of the camp, but smugglers are trying to use children to fill them in.</p>

Another said that getting a job was his most important concern. All the boys agreed that their number one desire is to go home.</p>

                    <p>One 12-year-old boy working in carpentry said he wanted &ldquo;a different job, any job.&rdquo; His issue was not the nature of the job, nor the conditions of his work, but the simple fact that he did not earn enough to pay his family’s rent.</p>

                <div class="body_text">
                    <p>Individual case management is a core aspect of the child protection response in both Lebanon and Jordan. UN agencies and their partners have established functioning referral systems throughout both countries to identify children who face protection risks, manage their cases and refer them to appropriate services.</p>

                    <p>Case managers and social workers visit refugees in their homes to assess their needs. In addition to providing social counselling and emotional support, they develop an action plan with families to promote their children’s safety and ensure that they can attend school or take part in other educational services. Where possible, they work together to remove children from the work force, or at least minimize the negative effects of working. In serious cases of violence, abuse or neglect, national authorities become involved.</p>

                    <p>Case managers and social workers emphasize to parents the importance of education, the potentially harmful effects of child labour and the impact that domestic violence has on children. Given the pressing financial needs of many families, it is often not possible to find a way for children to stop working. In such situations, case managers also interact directly with children’s employers to minimize the risks they face in the workplace. This can include providing materials to improve their safety at work and negotiating with employers to ensure they can access at least informal education alongside work.</p>

                    <p>Where necessary, case managers and social workers refer children to UNHCR and partners for specialized services such as health care, psychosocial support, or legal advice. In certain cases, they might also help families to access financial assistance, or provide in-kind donations from private donors, such as clothing or toys. Case managers and social workers follow up regularly with children and their families and monitor implementation of the action plan.</p>
