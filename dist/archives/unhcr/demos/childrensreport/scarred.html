                <p>While some Syrian refugee children have escaped serious physical injury, few have avoided the psychological repercussions that come from living in the midst of a war.</p>

                <p>In interviews with 81 refugee children in Jordan and Lebanon, 22 children, or parents speaking on their behalf, said they continued to be deeply distressed by violence they witnessed in Syria.</p>

                <p>Sheeraz Mukhaimer, a community-based case manager with the International Medical Corps (IMC) in Irbid, Jordan, has worked with more than 90 Syrian refugee children over the past nine months. She has met a number of children who have not only seen their family members killed before their eyes, but have then helped to move and bury their bodies&mdash;a horrific experience which is not easy to leave behind.</p>

                <p>The two UNHCR registration assistants, Therese Sarkis and Tatiana Nassar, in Tyre, Lebanon, each typically register between seven and 12 families a day. Both have backgrounds in psychology and see at least one or two children every day they can identify with acute distress or depression.</p>

                <p>According to Sarkis, some girls and boys have memorized the sounds of war. Children have described to her how they used to hide together under the bed when they heard a missile close by. <span class="tweet-me-light" data-sharemetaid="scar_03"><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=The%20scars%20of%20war%3A%20girls%20as%20young%20as%203%20recognize%20the%20sound%20of%20a%20gun%2C%20missile%20or%20bomb%20http%3A%2F%2Frfg.ee%2FrgxXW%20%23FutureOfSyria">Even girls as young as three years old recognize the sound of a gun, missile or bomb.<img src="img/twitter-16x20-blue.png" alt=""/></a></span></p>

                <p>According to parents, the war in Syria has had a lasting impact on their children, including trouble sleeping, horrifying flashbacks, bed-wetting and even speech problems. A 16-year-old boy from Homs, now living in Amman, had trouble sleeping when he first arrived in Jordan. He found the absence of gunfire&mdash;which was a constant backdrop in Homs&mdash;unsettling. He was worried it would start again.</p>

                <p>A father from Aleppo who now lives in Tyre, in southern Lebanon, said the effects of war had caused his sons&mdash;aged three, seven and nine&mdash;to become bed-wetters. This is a common symptom among distressed children in conflict situations. His second son, Hani, who was toilet trained long ago, was unable to control his urination even during the day.</p>

                <p>A six-year-old boy, now living in Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley, developed a stutter after surviving bombings close to his home in Jobar, Damascus. The mother of a two-year-old girl in Mount Lebanon said that whenever her daughter hears a plane, she runs inside crying with her hands covering her ears.</p>

                <p>Another mother, in Beirut, said her seven-year-old son was so severely affected that he imagines that his father, who was killed in the war, is still alive.</p>

                    <p>Before he escaped Syria, Firas saw a bullet strike his sister’s head while they were in a car. He also heard stories of young girls being raped, including his neighbour’s daughter, and about men being tied up and tortured in the village next to his. The women were raped and burned. Afterwards, he saw the devastation first-hand when he and his friends buried the women’s bodies.</p>

                    <p>Now, in addition to reliving those atrocities he worries constantly about what will happen to his family back in Syria.</p>

                <div class="body_text">
                    <p>Staff from UNHCR and partner organizations said that some displaced children in Jordan and Lebanon have become hyperactive or aggressive, while others have turned unusually quiet and shy. Parents said that constant crying is common.</p>

                    <p>In an IMC/UNICEF assessment in Jordan’s Za’atari camp, 71 per cent of 255 adolescents said ‘withdrawal’ from everyday life was one of their main coping mechanisms.<a href="#footnote10" class="footnote-number">2</a></p>

                    <p>According to Sheeraz Mukhaimer, with IMC in Irbid, Jordan, the distress often weakens children’s ability to interact with others. Mukhaimer said this can prevent children from wanting to go to school, participate in recreational activities, or in extreme cases even leave the house.</p>

                    <p>The most important support network for psychologically affected children is usually in the home. Yet Syrian refugee parents and caregivers, struggling with their own scars, can find it difficult to support their own children emotionally.</p>

                    <p>Abdel-Menhen, a 25-year-old refugee outreach worker in southern Lebanon, said that when he knocks at some families’ doors to offer support or monitor their well-being, they are so haunted by their past experiences that instead of answering, they hide.</p>

                    <p>According to IMC and UNHCR staff, children living in small or overcrowded homes often overhear their parents talking about their experiences in Syria, the losses they have suffered and the stresses they feel being displaced.</p>

                    <p>Many families regularly tune into television channels featuring disturbing footage from Syria. This can cause children to relive horrifying events, increasing their own sense of anxiety.</p>
