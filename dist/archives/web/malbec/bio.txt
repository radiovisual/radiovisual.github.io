Guitar-based, pop-fluent and beat-savvy, the Los Angeles-based five-piece band Malbec pours out a richly textured sound as diverse as the backgrounds and styles of its members. Alike only in the extreme spirit behind their playing, their collective artistic statement makes for an improbable but blissful musical marriage. Theirs is a hyper-melodic and intensely atmospheric tonal landscape propelled by soulful vocals, observant lyrics and brooding bass lines. Underneath, a tightly calibrated hip-hop foundation counterpoints Malbec's fluid double guitar signature, resulting in an authentic and ambient groove impossible to define by any of the "genre hyphenates" bandied about in the brave new world of post-modern music.Founded in early 2004, Malbec's unique dynamic does share a quality or two with the grape after which it's named. The band's titular tip of the hat to righteous earthy passion is a link to the roots of lead vocalist/songwriter/lyricist/guitarist Pablo Signori, whose family emigrated from Argentina to the outskirts of Detroit where he grew up, heavily imbibing indie rock and jazz.  Malbec's most celebrated contemporary incarnation-where it's truly come into its own-is as a prime component of complex Argentinean red wines from the country's Mendoza region. "My uncle owns a bodega there.  I've visited often," says Pablo,  "and I've been strongly influenced by Argentine folk music. It's very singer-songwriter driven, melodic with heavy beats. The indigenous drum, the bombo, mimics an 808 kick...it's so low, it can sound like hip-hop." In fact, when Pablo bonded with Malbec's beat maker supreme, Sidney Miller, he realized the reason a hip-hop underpinning felt so right was its natural fit with his Argentine instincts-and the ballast it gave his more ethereal alt-rock/pop sensibilities.In the beginning, Malbec sprang out of Signori's friendship with Berkeley, CA-born, Nick Ruth. Both classically trained guitarists, they met while studying at Indiana University. While there, Pablo was developing adventurous solo work fusing folk and melodic rock with the range of technique afforded by his grasp of classical playing. Ruth's own guitar virtuosity had first emerged in his early teen years as he realized he could master all his favorite rock songs. Nick embarked on a long immersion in purely classical playing before landing at Indiana for graduate work...and a change of direction."When I heard what Pablo was creating," recalls Ruth, "I thought, 'I'd way rather be doing that.' I realized there'd been about a four-year period when I wasn't aware of anything musically that wasn't 300 years old. Pablo would introduce me to, say, Radiohead, or Coldplay, and it was amazing."They flirted with the idea of a band, but after graduating, Nick headed back to the Bay Area in 2002, and Pablo set off for L.A. to hone his solo efforts. He began mixing it up with the aforementioned beat master Miller, a brilliant laptopist/keyboard artist known for his work with Soul Diggaz Productions out of New Jersey. An L.A. native, Miller had attended University of Florida, and his penchant for southern rap and Cash Money-style beats provided just the right groove.  "When Pablo told me about Sidney," says Nick, "the plot thickened. I knew we had something." A session during an L.A. visit convinced Ruth to bid Berkeley good bye and head south to join in full time.Malbec further gelled with the arrival of 18 year-old force-of-nature drummer Mark Pontius, also a SoCal surfing prodigy with a jones for rootsy hip-hop and total props for Ahmir "?uestlove" Thompson.  "One audition," says Pablo, "and it was done." The quintet finalized with Samantha Barbera, who Signori knew from Indiana, where her father is a noted blues guitarist.  Talented on guitar herself, she stepped up and learned bass to join Malbec, throwing another stylistic wrench into the sonic brew. "Sam was raised on a strict diet of punk and hardcore," says Pablo, "her bass lines are very dark." Nick adds, "She'll take a song in a major key, and somehow make it minor." Not a downer in any sense, though, her simple and elegant lines seamlessly flow into the more-than-the-sum-of-its-parts phenomenon that is Malbec.Today, this unlikely cross-cultural collision has earned a loyal following, packing L.A. area shows at the Viper Room, House of Blues, Spaceland and other scenic spots-as well as NYC venues including Joe's Pub. Their vibe has been prominently featured in film and television, most notably via the sublimely stellar track, "Solstice."  Produced by ex-Eve 6 drummer Tony Fagenson and ace fiddler Gabe Witcher, it's heard on the soundtrack of both Ewan McGregor's Bravo road-trip mini-series Long Way Around and Fox's DVD of the making of Flight Of The Phoenix. Following a Spring '05 string of dates surrounding Detroit's major Motor City Music Conference and Austin's famed South by Southwest, plans are underway for an extensive fall college tour and a self-released EP to build on Malbec's already considerable momentum.Signori and Ruth attribute a sense of fate to their ascendance.  "Everything with Malbec," says Pablo, "feels meant to be. When we started out, we were giddy to be playing together, it came easily, and it's never stopped being fun.  We didn't plan it, it just happened. When we jam, it's often improvisational, organic. It's like when I'm writing a song that just sounds right--I'll look at the lyrics and realize it's something I'm dealing with in my life...each track becomes a different perspective of the human experience."Different perspectives merging as one is really the bottom line for Malbec. "What unites us," they say, "is a common thread of mutual appreciation.  We trust each other with whatever we bring to the table, and we work it out together."  In vino veritas, indeed.###
