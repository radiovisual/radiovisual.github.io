This content area can be easily changed out by an outside file with no need to ever open the flash file, that means that it will be
easy for anyone on the team who wants to add a news item here. The Flash file is already set up to handle any size news section, so it wont matter how many entries we add. Good times! and the other nice part about this is that HTML can be parsed from within the flash file, that means that if we have a link or anything we need to add here in the news section it can be done from that outside file as well.
