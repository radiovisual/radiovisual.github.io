              <p>Genesee Home is incorporated as a 501- C 3 non-profit corporation. It is governed by a Board of Directors, made up of Christian men and women, with a variety of business and ministry experiences who all share a common calling to serve the Lord's "under shepherds," the pastors of His church.</p>

<p>Genesee Home leases facilities from the Neff Family Ranch, which is owned and operated by Paul and Kathy Neff. The Neff Family Ranch is an operating, natural beef cattle ranch. The Neff's raise Black Angus Beef on natural mountain grass meadows in a picture perfect environment which they sell directly to consumers. Genesee Home and the Rranch co-exist on the same 1600 acres.</p>

<p>The Neff's, together with their family foundation, "Servants-Heart", provided the initial start up funds needed by Genesee Home. They are committed to support Genesee Home on an ongoing basis. To avoid any appearance of conflict of interest, Paul and Kathy Neff are not members of the Genesee Home Board of Directors.</p>

<p>Genesee Home grew out of Paul and Kathy Neff's prayerful consideration of why God has blessed them to be steward's of this ranch. They spent several years investigating and prayerfully considering how best to use the ranch for the advancement of Kingdom purposes. Their heart for the local church, Pastors, missionaries, and their spouses has resulted in Genesee Home. It is Paul and Kathy's desire to see God work through the ranch and its beauty to refresh, renew and rekindle the hearts of all those who visit.
