               <p>Throughout the scriptures, God led chosen leaders off to be alone with Him for times of rejuvenation. Genesee Home is a place that offers you that same type of peace and privacy. Enjoy quiet time for study, prayer and communion with God. While at Genesee Home you can once again hear His still, small voice that comes to encourage and strengthen you for ministry in our hectic world. One of the great benefits that we provide is a setting in which a Pastor or Missionary and spouse can listen for His voice.</p>

<p>From the moment you descend into its lush expanse, Genesee Valley will envelope you with the beauty of His creation. Peaceful forests, scenic meadows, idyllic creeks are all set against a backdrop of mountain peaks. The very location can stir one's soul.</p>

<p>The Genesee Home - a 19th century Victorian stone house once used as a stage coach stop, has recently been completely renovated to offer all of the most modern comforts and amenities. Every detail has been designed to provide couples a place to relax and reflect. The rooms are beautiful and, well, even romantic. We have taken care of everything because we want you to relax and enjoy being served.</p>

<p>Whether you desire to spend time alone with God, your spouse, or time with others, you will have ample opportunity to do so. Take long walks outdoors, watch the sunset from the our double hammock, pray and meditate in our rustic prayer barn or just relax and enjoy your room.</p>

<p>Breakfast and lunch are unstructured. Come to breakfast at your leisure, eat downstairs or take it to your room. Lunch can be wherever you would like. We even provide picnic baskets for a special time for the two of you. During the day and evening there is a variety activities, including, but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
    <li> Library</li>
    <li> Walking, jogging and hiking trails</li>
    <li> Mountain biking</li>
    <li> Canoeing on Indian Creek</li>
    <li> Fishing and swimming in our six small lakes</li>
    <li> Camp fires</li>
    <li> Exploring God's creation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Evening meals are shared with the other ministry couples and our host couple, Bev and Charley. After dinner there is a short time of guided discussion on marriage, family and ministry. At these sumptuous meals you will have the opportunity for fellowship and mutual encouragement.</p>

<p>Charley & Bev's desire is to make you feel welcome and to be available to pray or listen to you and your spouse.</p>
