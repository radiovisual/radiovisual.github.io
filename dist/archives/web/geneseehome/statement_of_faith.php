              <ul>  
              <li> We believe the Bible is God's infallible written Word, authoritative in all matters of faith and practice. We believe that it was uniquely, verbally and fully inspired by the Holy Spirit and was written without error in the original manuscripts. It is the supreme and final authority on which it speaks.</li>
<li> There is one true God, eternally existing in three persons---Father, Son, and Holy Spirit---each of whom possesses equally all the attributes of Deity and the characteristics of personality.</li>
<li> We believe in the deity of our Lord Jesus Christ, and His virgin birth, sinless life, miracles, vicarious and atoning death through His shed blood, His bodily resurrection, ascension to the right hand of the Father and His personal return in power and glory.</li>
<li> Humanity was originally created in the image of God. They sinned by disobeying God; thus, they were alienated from their Creator. That historic fall brought all humanity under divine condemnation.</li>
<li> Humanity's nature was corrupted by the Fall and is totally unable to please God. Every person is in need of regeneration and renewal by the Holy Spirit.</li>
<li> The salvation of any person is wholly the work of God's free grace and is not the result, in whole or in part of human works, goodness or religious ceremony. God imputes His righteousness to those who put their faith in Christ alone for their salvation, and thereby justifies them in His sight.</li>
<li> The Holy Spirit has come into the world to reveal and glorify Christ and to apply the saving work of Christ to humanity. He convicts and draws sinners to Christ, imparts new life to them, continually indwells them from the moment of spiritual birth and seals them until the day of redemption. His fullness, power and control are appropriated in the believers by faith.</li>
<li> Every believer is called to so live in the power of the indwelling Spirit that they will not fulfill the lust of the flesh, but will bear fruit to the glory of God.</li>
<li> We believe every believer has a scriptural mandate to share his life of faith in Christ.</li>
<li> We believe that we are engaged in constant spiritual warfare with the principalities and power of evil, who are seeking to overthrow the Church and frustrate its task of world evangelization.</li>
<li> Jesus Christ is the Head of the Church, His Body, which is composed of all people, living and dead, who have been joined to Him through saving faith.</li>
<li> Jesus Christ will come again to the earth---personally, visibly and bodily---to consummate history and to fulfill the eternal plan of God. There will be a resurrection of both the saved and the lost; they that are saved unto the resurrection of life and they that are lost unto the resurrection of damnation.</li>
