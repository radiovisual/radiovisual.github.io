             <p>Answers To The Most Frequently Asked Questions:</p>


<p><strong>1. Where is Genesee Home located?</strong><br />
Conveniently located away from it all, Genesee Home sits on a 1600 acre ranch in a beautiful valley surrounded by mountains (3600 ft. elevation) in the northern Sierra Nevada Mountains of California: 3 hrs. NE of Sacramento, 3 hrs. SE of Redding, 2 hrs. NW of Reno, NV. <a href="area_map.php">Click here to view map</a>.</p>

<p><strong>2. What is the cost?</strong><br />
$395 per couple for 5 nights and all your meals!</p>

<p><strong>3. What kind of accommodations do you provide?</strong><br />
One would consider Genesee Home a "high-end Bed and Breakfast", although we provide all your meals! An 1880's Victorian home that has been completely renovated and decorated to the tee, with 5 gorgeous bedrooms each with their own private bath! The guests continue to be overwhelmed with the detail and how beautiful everything is, commenting that the pictures do not do justice to the real thing. <a href="photo_gallery.php">Click here to view photos</a>.</p>

<p><strong>4. Can we bring our children?</strong><br />
No, Genesee Home is an adult retreat facility for pastors, missionaries and their spouses. A special time set aside for them to be alone with each other and God: no phone, no TV, no kids!</p>

<p><strong>5. Is there any program at Genesee Home?</strong><br />
Genesee Home provides the time and place for a self-guided Sabbath week. The only appointed times together are the evening meals which include guided discussions on family and ministry (2 hrs. total time) and Wednesday afternoon 3:00pm-4:30pm there is a women's tea in the Parlor and men's coffee in the Prayer Barn.</p>

<p><strong>6. What is there to do at Genesee Home?</strong><br />
All year around: exploring God's creation, walking, jogging, hiking, biking (we have 5 beautiful mountain bikes) and an extensive library is provided for your enjoyment. Summer: canoeing, fishing, and swimming in the creeks and ponds, horseshoes, lawn croquet or bocce ball. Winter: even though the roads all stay dry and clear, there may be enough snow to build a snowman, go tubing or even snowshoe. Visit our <a href="activities.php">activities page</a> or <a href="photo_gallery.php">photo gallery</a>.</p>

<p><strong>7. How long is the "week" and could we stay for just 2 or 3 nights?</strong><br />
Guests check in anytime after 3:00pm Sunday afternoon and leave anytime after a hot breakfast Friday morning. Most of our guests comment that it took them at least 2 days just to unwind, relax, and get physically refreshed before they could really begin to get emotionally and spiritually refreshed. They have asked us not to make it any shorter than the 5 nights.</p>

<p><strong>8. What weeks do you have open?</strong><br />
Genesee Home runs all year around. You can view or calendar <a href="calendar.php">here</a>.</p>


<p><strong>9. How far in advance do we have to register?</strong><br />
If possible, it is best if reservations can be made 6 months to 1 year ahead, however often there is still an open room or two in any given week. Give us a call even at the last minute, because there could be a room open.</p>

<p><strong>10. How do I register?</strong><br />
Simply go to our <a href="request_a_visit.php">Request A Visit</a> page and fill out the form. You are given an opportunity to fill in your 1st, 2nd, 3rd choices of weeks and your 1st, 2nd, 3rd choices of rooms. Complete the form and press "Send". We will respond to you as quickly as possible with a confirmation of week and room.</p>

<p><strong>11. How can I get to Genesee Home?</strong><br />
You can come by plane, or car. We are in northern California and only 3 hours from the I-5 and 2 hours from the Reno Airport. Check out the <a href="driving_directions.php">driving directions</a> page for more info. The real question is not how, but when: as soon as possible.</p>
