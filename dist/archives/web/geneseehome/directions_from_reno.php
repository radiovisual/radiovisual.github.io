<p>Exit the airport and follow signs to Highway 395 North. Take 395 North for approximately 30 miles. till you see the exit for Highway 70 West toward Portola. Take the Highway 70 exit and continue West through Portola. Highway 89 joins Highway 70 approximately 10 miles West of Portola. Continue West on Highway 70/89 through Quincy until you come to the Junction of Highway 70 and 89 (approximately 10 miles North West of Quincy). Please note that Quincy is the last food and gas stations you will see on your way to Genesee Home. . Turn right (north) on Highway 89 toward Greenville, Lake Almanore for approximately 6 miles and then turn right on Arlington Road (Rt. A22) toward Taylorsville. (immediately after you turn right, you will notice a golf course on the left). Taylorsville is approximately 6 miles from Highway 89 (don't blink or you might miss Taylorsville). Continue on straight through town and approximately 1/2 mile out of town the road will "Y" and you will want to stay to the right. At the "Y" you will notice the rodeo grounds on the left. Continue on past the rodeo grounds for approximately 6 miles and as you see the wooded area opening up to a small valley, you will be entering Genesee Valley.</p>

<p>Genesee Home is approximately 6 miles east of Taylorsville. You will come into the valley and the town of Genesee will be the first set of buildings you come to. Genesee Home is the large red brick house on your right. Our driveway is just past the row of mail boxes on your right. If you go farther than 6 miles turn around for you have driven past Genesee Home.</p>

<p>Note if you are arriving in the dark, Genesee Home is approximately 6 miles east of Taylorsville. You will come into the valley and the first light you see on your right is Genesee Home. We will have the parking lot lights on for you. It is easy to miss the mail boxes at night. If you go farther than 6 miles, turn around. Come around to the front and we will meet you there. Please feel free to come right into GH no need to knock. You are Welcome.</p>
