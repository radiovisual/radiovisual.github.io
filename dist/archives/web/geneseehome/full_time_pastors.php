               <p><b>Pastors In Full Time Ministry</b></p>

<p>We recognize that Pastors are at the helm of ministry in the local church. They provide leadership, vision, teaching, support and counseling to the body of Christ. They equip the 'saints' for the work of ministry. Consequently, they often bear a heavy burden. Everyone relies on them for guidance, strength and support. They are under constant pressure to perform and be successful according to the standards of the world. Meanwhile, these same Pastors and their families live in a fish bowl of social and spiritual expectations which can seem overwhelming. Sometimes they can get so caught up in "doing" ministry and caring for others that they can neglect themselves and their primary relationships with God and their spouses.</p>

<p>At Genesee Home, we understand how important Pastors and their spouses are to God and how critical their role is in furthering His Kingdom through the local church. Because we love Pastors and their spouses, God has led us to create a retreat home which offers Pastoral couples an opportunity to spend quiet time together to strengthen their lives, marriages and ministries.. When Pastors take time out to focus on their relationships with God, and their spouses, everything in their lives and ministry works better. When they step out of their busy schedules and have the opportunity to relax and reflect some very important things happen:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>A deeper relationship with God</li>
    <li>A stronger marriage</li>
    
      <li>A ministry for the long term</li></ul>

<p>Genesee Home provides just such a setting. It is a place where you can step out of the pressure cooker of daily ministry and into a beautiful mountain setting. A place to listen to the still, small voice of God without the distractions of daily life and ministry. It's a place where you can think, pray, read and simply relax.</p>

<p>At Genesee Home, you have an opportunity to:</p>
 <ul>
      <li>
   Reflect on your relationship with God</li>
    <li>Rekindle your relationship with your spouse</li>
    <li>If desired, interact with our host couple and other ministry couples</li>
</ul>
<p>Genesee Home is not intended to be a vacation, nor is it for the Pastor who is in need of focused counseling. Our goal is to create a safe and relaxing environment where you can grow closer to God and your spouse. Whether you feel worn out from ministry or you are searching for a catalyst God can use to help to guide you forward, Genesee Home can be that next step.</p>
