               <p>Welcome to Genesee Home's special web page for Missionary Couples. The best kept secret in the world until now was Missionaries coming to Genesee Home. What better place to enjoy a quiet, relaxing time in a supreme example of God's creation. A visit to Genesee Home is a Sabbath Rest for renewal and refreshment of your ministry and marriage.</p>

<p>From its beginnings Genesee Home has been dedicated to providing an excellent retreat setting for men and women in full time Christian ministry. Although our primary emphasis has been on pastoral couples, Missionary Couples have always been in our hearts and prayers. We know that those who serve on the mission field are often faced with unique stresses and troubles. Living in a different culture, isolated from friends and family and learning a new language can take its toll. Then, of course, there are the 'every day demands' of ministry and soon the goal of enjoying a vital spiritual life becomes difficult.</p>

<p>Genesee Home can help you. We provide beautiful accommodations with your own well appointed <a href="photos.php#Garden">private room</a> and bath. You are served excellent gourmet meals prepared especially for you with loving care. In addition, there are endless<a href="activities.php"> recreational opportunities</a> available as well as peace and quiet so that you may enter into God's Sabbath Rest. At Genesee Home you set your own agenda and can be as active as you desire. Our pricing for all of this and more is $395 per week per couple.

<p>Our prayer for you during your stay at Genesee Home is that you will truly experience a Sabbath Rest, be filled with God's Holy Spirit, be strengthened in your marriage and be sustained by God's living water. Our desire is to welcome you with hospitality and send you on your way filled with the peace of Christ.</p>

<p>Of particular interest is our low level programming. As a Missionary Couple we don't add to your already busy schedule. We provide the space and time for you to get alone with God and report to your Savior all you have recently done and taught. We encourage you to spend time as a couple walking our beautiful property, taking time to talk about the deep things of your relationship and to pray together in long blocks of uninterrupted time.</p>

<p>There are two ways you can take advantage of a week at Genesee Home. You may register for any week that is available and spend time with four other couples from different ministries and backgrounds.</p>

<p>We encourage you to complete our Request A Visit form so we can reserve a space for you and your spouse to step out of your busy life and ministry and into God's presence.</p>

<p>Scholarships are available. After filling out our request a visit form, click on the link provided to go to our scholarship application page.</p>
