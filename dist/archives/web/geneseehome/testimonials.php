                <p>The best way to say it is that I came here to find "joy in the journey" to have it renewed to what I once had. To be reminded that He is my Lord and in whom I should go to find rest. Through reading, fellowship with all the other couples and through our talks with Bev and Charley I caught a glimpse of what I once knew. It was good. I can walk away from this place with new insight, an eternal perspective and an appreciation for the Sabbath Rest. This time has given me thoughts and ideas to take home and to put into action. My husband Jon soaks up whatever he can get from other pastors and from being in the presence of God. We have enjoyed every bit of what Genesee Home has to offer and praise our Lord and Savior for bringing us to this place. Jon and I will go back with a better understanding of what God has for our lives, both in ministry and in our marriage. We give God the Glory for working in our lives this week.</p>

              <p>Thank you Lord for this strong tower, this haven of rest. Please bless every person responsible for this great blessing of renewal, relaxation, and revelation of your will. We are so grateful. This was our 2nd visit and it even exceeded the first. The "heavenly" bed is going to make it tough to go home to our own (and I never thought I'd say that). Bev and Charley and Connie thank you for your gracious hospitality and Lorraine I am sure we have gained five pounds! Bless you all.</p>

                <p> It is really wonderful to be at Genesee Home. We felt as it is a gift of God has given to us, provided by a very kind people. We are really thankful to God because of those whome are supporting and for those whom are helping at Genesee Home and trying their best to make our time, our hosting and our fellowship with God with my spouse, with our friends and with them exlant. We came last year 2005, and this year, we are praying also to come next year 2007.. Look how it is really wonderful and blessed Home!!</p>

                <p>Having these 5 days following the Hume Lake pastors retreat has been one of the best vacation/respites we've ever had. I felt integrated with my marriage and ministry rather than at odds with them. The typical conflicts of what to do and what we can afford were not part of our time together as a couple. I'm not one to hang around the bedroom but this room was an exceptional suite that especially pampered my wife. And I have slept more hours and awakened more refreshed than I can recall. How wonderful to go down for great meals with great people every day with a whole day ahead free from pressures. Charlie and Bev made it easy to be ourselves and made it all come together with their nurturing touch. And what a diverse group we were. I look forward to exchanging phone numbers and addresses so we can meet again. Rested and refreshed in body, mind and spirit.</p>

<p>You are in for the biggest treat in your life! I can only echo Kevin's comments! This has been pure joy - a tremendous blessing. Drink up every moment it goes by fast. I can't believe we have to leave tomorrow. We will be back - God willing! I feel so nurtured too by Bev and Charlie and Lorraine - Bravo what a menu...Doc was a wonderful inspiration as well - you'll see. I will carry this time away with me and will have it to reflect on - It will be my soul food. Till we meet again - God Bless Genesee House and all the hands that put it together. For ever grateful.</p>


</p>P.S. (Since there is some margin left) It's time to take our bags down to the van. I smell a delicious country breakfast. Goodbyes are awkward for me so I want to be personal here and say God bless the vision and ministry of Genesee Home, the Neff Family and generous supporters and especially Bev and Charlie for sharing their love and their lives with us. Our love to you.</p>

                <p>"Matt. 28 says, 'Come unto me all ye who labor.and I will give you rest.' Eugene Peterson says, 'and I will show you the rhythms of grace'. That's what I have felt this week: the rhythms of grace. Also Philemon 20 says, 'Yes, brother, let me have joy from you in the Lord; refresh my heart in the Lord.'. That's what you both, Bev and Charley, do. You have refreshed the hearts of the saints."</p>
